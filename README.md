# RickRollBatch
After you've extracted the lol.bat file, create a folder (in the exact same directory as the .bat) that has the exact name of "data" (no quotation marks!!!!) and put inside that folder a rickroll video (or smt else) with the exact name of "nggyu.mp4" (again just ignore the quotation marks). If you want to do smt else good luck with editing the .bat file (no offense intended).
